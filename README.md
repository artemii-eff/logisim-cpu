# LogisimCPU

In this project, I created a Turing-complete CPU in Logisim. From this, I created some documentation showing the functionality. Running code on the CPU is difficult, as it required writing machine code. To solve this, I created a basic Assembly language that includes loading, writing, and setting values in one of a 3 registers (`REG A`, `REG B`, and `MemAddrReg`), making conditional and nonconditional jumps, and basic arithmetic (+, -, x, /). 


# What I'm Learning
- Functionality of Turing-complete CPUs
- How to go about writing a programming language
- How to create a compiler
- How to create a simple IDE
